      This specification extends MediaStreamTrack as defined in
      [[!GETUSERMEDIA]] to provide an media-content-type hint attribute. This
      optional hint permits <code>MediaStreamTrack</code> consumers such as
      <code>PeerConnection</code> or <code>MediaRecorder</code> to encode or
      process contained media with methods more appropriate to the type of
      content that is being consumed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Adding a media-content-type hint provides a way for an application to help
      track consumers make more informed decision of what encoder parameters and
      processing algorithms to use on the consumed content.

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      Algorithms used for processing speech and music differ greatly.
      Echo-cancellation algorithms developed for speech-type content might not
      work well on music, and noise-suppression algorithms might remove drum
      snares or other "noisy" content. While this makes speech more intelligible
      it is less appropriate for music signals.
    </p>
    <p>
      For video, webcam content often require denoising and is often
      intelligible even when downscaled or with high quantization levels.
      Screencast content of presentations or webpages with a lot of text content
      is completely unintelligible if the quantization levels are too high or
      if the content is downscaled or otherwise blurry.
    </p>
    <p>
      Without automatic detection of media content, a
      <code>MediaStreamTrack</code> consumer can only make an educated guess.
      This guess may be based on assuming that screencast content (such as
      chrome.desktopCapture) contains text content and must use low quantization
      levels, and drop frames extensively to meet bitrate requirements. Another
      assumption is that regular USB video devices provide webcam video, and
      higher quantization levels and downscaling are acceptible.
    </p>
    <p>
      While usually appropriate this educated guess leads to sub-optimal
      settings when incorrect. This manifests as high framedropping when
      screencasting fluid content such as a movie or streaming a video game and
      treating it as text. Treating highly-detailed content as regular webcam
      video on the other hand leads to too-blurry content when being either
      quantized or downscaled beyond readability to meet bitrate requirements.
      This mismatch may happen when HDMI video-capture cards are believed to be
      USB webcams but actually screencast webpage text.
    </p>
    <p>
      In some cases the web application can make a more-educated guess or take
      user input to inform consumers of what kind of content is being encoded. A
      web application that streams video-game content would be able to preserve
      fluid motion from desktop capture at the cost of individual frame detail.
      A music-studio application would be able to prevent noise suppression from
      removing snares from a music track.
    </p>
    <p>
      These settings are not intended to replace encoder-level settings
      completely but rather complement them with a simpler hint that does not
      require broad knowledge of video encoders, audio-processing steps or
      more extensive tuning.

    <h2>Extension to MediaStreamTrack</h2>
    <pre class="idl">
    interface MediaStreamTrack {
      // ...
      attribute DOMString mediaContentTypeHint;
    };
    </pre>
    <p>
      The <dfn>mediaContentTypeHint</dfn> attribute may be set from the web
      application to override or provide a hint of what type of content is
      contained within the track. This property is initially set to either
      <code>null</code> or an implementation-defined guess, likely based on the
      track source.
    </p>
    <p>
      For audio and video the defined types are as defined below when
      <code>MediaStreamTrack.kind</code> is set to <code>"audio"</code> and
      <code>"video"</code> respectively. Setting an invalid value shall reset
      the attribute to its initial value.
    </p>
    <p>
      Setting <code>mediaContentTypeHint</code> to <code>null</code> should
      reset it to the track's initial value.
    </p>
    <h3>Audio content types</h3>
    <pre class="idl">
    enum AudioContentTypeHint {
      "speech",
      "music"
    };
    </pre>
    <p>
      Audio content types are only applicable when
      <code>MediaStreamTrack.kind</code> is set to <code>"audio"</code> and
      contains an audio track. <code>mediaContentTypeHint</code> should only
      accept values defined within <code>AudioContentTypeHint</code> when being
      applied to an audio track.
    </p>
    <table class="simple"><tbody><tr><th colspan="2">Enumeration description</th></tr>
      <tr><td><code id="idl-def-AudioContentTypeHint.speech">speech</code></td><td><p>
        The track should be treated as if it contains speech data. Consuming
        this signal it may be appropriate to apply noise suppression or boosting
        the intelligibility of the incoming signal.
      </p></td></tr>
      <tr><td><code id="idl-def-AudioContentTypeHint.music">music</code></td><td><p>
        The track should be treated as if it contains music data. Generally this
        might imply tuning or turning off audio-processing components that are
        used to process speech data to prevent the audio from being distorted.
      </p></td></tr>
    </tbody></table>
    <h3>Video content types</h3>
    <pre class="idl">
    enum VideoContentTypeHint {
      "fluid",
      "detailed"
    };
    </pre>
    <p>
      Video content types are only applicable when
      <code>MediaStreamTrack.kind</code> is set to <code>"video"</code> and
      contains a video track. <code>mediaContentTypeHint</code> should only
      accept values defined within <code>VideoContentTypeHint</code> when being
      applied to a video track.
    </p>
    <table class="simple"><tbody><tr><th colspan="2">Enumeration description</th></tr>
      <tr><td><code id="idl-def-VideoContentTypeHint.fluid">fluid</code></td><td><p>
        The track should be treated as if it contains fluid video. This is
        normally webcam video, movies or video games. Quantization artefacts and
        downscaling is acceptible to preserve fluid motion while retaining
        bitrates. During low bitrates when compromises have to be made, less
        effort is spent on preserving edge quality and detail.
      </p></td></tr>
      <tr><td><code id="idl-def-VideoContentTypeHint.detail">detailed</code></td><td><p>
        The track should be treated as if video details are extra important.
        This is generally applicable to presentations or web pages with text
        content, painting or line art. This setting would normally optimize for
        detail in the resulting individual frames rather than smooth playback.
        Quantization artefacts or downscaling that make small text or line art
        unintelligible should be avoided.
